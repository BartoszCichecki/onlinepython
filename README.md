Online Python
============

Online Python is a tool for employers to let job applicants send their Python scripts for evaluation. The scripts are run in a separate Python-interpreter process and using PyPy's sandboxing feature, the scripts are safe to run.

Online Python is a project created for 02819 Data Mining using Python course at DTU.
